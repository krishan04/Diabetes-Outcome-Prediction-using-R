# Diabetes-Outcome-Prediction-using-R
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop and compare multiple predictive models using a diabetes dataset. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applying machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes outcomes. The models implemented include k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. The performance of each model is evaluated and compared based on accuracy.
